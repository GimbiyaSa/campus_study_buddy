# Operations

## Project Management Approach
We use **Scrum** methodology:
- Work in 2-week sprints
- Track stories and tasks in GitHub Projects
- Hold lightweight standups (async when needed)
- Review progress at sprint review
- Retrospective helps us improve continuously

This approach fits a small, part-time student team because it provides structure without being overwhelming.
